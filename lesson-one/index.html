            <h1>Web Development: an Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Web development is often broken up into two halves: front-end web development — what you see when you visit a webpage — and back-end web development, which is how servers work to bring us things like Google search, Amazon, Netflix, and so forth.  We're learning front-end web development.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The important thing to realize is that literally every site you've ever been to uses the front-end web languages you're learning here.  How do I know that?  Because web browsers only speak three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Even when back-end developers are doing their thing, they have to account for the fact that the visiters to their websites are only going to end up seeing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                As an example, let's get a brief sense of what happens when you visit a website.  Let's say you open Chrome; Chrome is a program (much like any other) on your computer, but it specializes in one thing: sending requests for and receiving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  That's really all it is.  When you type in a web address (called a domain name), Chrome sends out a request over the web, and eventually gets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript back.  
            </p>
            <p>
                All the other stuff that goes on over the web is concerned with creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you see.  That happens on a server (or increasingly frequently a series of servers working together, as in the cloud).  We're not going to go very far down that road in this class, but be aware that it does exist, and that that's where a lot of the really tough programming happens.
